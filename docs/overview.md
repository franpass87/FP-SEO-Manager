# FP SEO Performance Overview

FP SEO Performance provides an on-page SEO analyzer with configurable checks, bulk audits, and admin-facing guidance for WordPress editors. The plugin embeds actionable insights into the editing workflow so teams can standardize search hygiene without leaving the dashboard.

## Key Capabilities

- **Analyzer metabox** – surfaces pass, warning, and failure states for metadata, headings, canonical URLs, robots directives, Open Graph, Twitter cards, schema presets, and internal links.
- **Bulk auditing** – batches analysis for selected post types and statuses, caches the most recent run for 24 hours, and exports CSV summaries for stakeholders.
- **Admin bar badge** – displays the current post score alongside quick links to the analyzer results.
- **Site Health integration** – reports outstanding SEO concerns directly within WordPress Site Health.
- **Configurable defaults** – allow administrators to tune thresholds, toggle checks, and manage capabilities without editing code.

## Getting Started

1. Install and activate the plugin.
2. Visit **SEO Performance → Settings** to review defaults and enable the admin bar badge if needed.
3. Edit a post to explore the analyzer metabox and confirm the checks relevant to your workflow.
4. Use the Bulk Auditor to run larger reviews or export data for audits.
